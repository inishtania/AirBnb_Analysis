# ⭐ Capstone 02: Analysis of Airbnb Listings in Bangkok 2012-2022<br />

As part of the capstone project at Purwadhika BSD, I was tasked with assessing my data analysis skills by analyzing Airbnb listing data for the period 2012-2022.
My first step was to understand the dataset to:
<br />
1. Identify stakeholders to whom I will present my analysis.<br />
2. Identify the issues these stakeholders face.<br />
3. Formulate preliminary hypotheses that might address these issues.<br />
4. Provide evidence as to whether these hypotheses are supported by the data.<br />

After conducting basic analyses to understand the data, here is the context I developed.

**Objective of Analysis**

The objective of this analysis is to provide insights to listing owners, known as hosts, both those who are already operational and those considering starting operations. This is because I aim to provide reviews to hosts to improve the two most important aspects: sales and profits.

**Problem Statement & Provisional Hypotheses**

When discussing sales and profits, it is closely related to traffic and determining the optimal price. Therefore, I formulated several problems to be developed into questions to assist in data exploration.

**A. Sales Improvement -> Traffic**

   What makes customers choose a particular listing over others?
   In exploring this analysis, I use the key metric in the availability 365 column. This is because the lower the availability value, the more bookings a listing has, and vice versa.


**B. Optimal Profit -> Price**

   What is the optimal price that hosts can set, attracting interest while still generating profits?
   In exploring this analysis, I use the key metric of price. This is because the higher the price, the fewer customers want to book, and vice versa.

## **Process of Analysis**
To conduct this analysis, I am using data from Airbnb Bangkok, which I have also uploaded to this repository. For additional data, I have also obtained the review.csv from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ or click this link to download (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G1ZPfnm1gNXimne1Kn2VPYUZIwoPzE1J/view?usp=sharing) to extract what guests love most about their stay in listings. Here are the step-by-step processes I followed:

✅Data understanding<br />
✅Finding duplicates<br />
✅Filling missing values<br />
✅Defining and deleting outliers<br />
✅Exploratory data analysis, where I analyze popularity and find the optimum price range.<br />
✅Various statistical tests, from descriptive to inferential statistics<br />
✅Conclusion<br />
